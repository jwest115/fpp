=== Array Subscript Expressions

An *array subscript expression* is an expression that selects an element from an
expression with array type.

==== Syntax

<<Expressions,_expression_>> `[` <<Expressions,_expression_>> `]`

==== Semantics

The following rules give the meaning of an array subscript expression
stem:[e] `[` stem:[i] `]`:

. stem:[e] must have <<Types_Array-Types,array type>> or
<<Types_Internal-Types_Anonymous-Array-Types,anonymous array type>>, _T_.

. stem:[i] must have <<Types_Internal-Types_Integer,integer type>>

. stem:[e] `[` stem:[i] `]` evaluates to an expression with the type
being the element type of _T_.

. stem:[e] `[` stem:[i] `]` has a value of the stem:[i]'th index of
stem:[e], where the first element is at index 0.

. stem:[i] is invalid if it is:

.. Negative

.. Greater than or equal to the length of stem:[e]

==== Example

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = [ 2, 4, 6 ] # a is an array value with elements 0, 1, 2
constant b = a[1] # b is an integer with value 4
constant c = [ 0, 1, 2 ][-1] # error, index is out of bounds (negative)
constant d = [ 0, 1, 2 ][3] # error, index is out of bounds (past end)
