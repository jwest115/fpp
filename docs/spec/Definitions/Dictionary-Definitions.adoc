=== Dictionary Definitions

Dictionary definitions are type definitions and constants that
are specified with the `dictionary` keyword and are included
in the dictionary.

==== Semantics

Type definitions that are included in the dictionary must be
<<Types_Displayable-Types, displayable>>.

Constants that are included in the dictionary must be one of
the following:

* A <<Types_Primitive-Integer-Types,primitive integer type>>.
* A <<Types_Floating-Point-Types,floating-point type>>.
* A <<Types_The-Boolean-Type,boolean type>>.
* A <<Types_String-Types,string type>>.
* An <<Types_Enum-Types,enum type>>.
