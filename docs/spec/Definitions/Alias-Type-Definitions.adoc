=== Alias Type Definitions

An *alias type definition* associates a named type with another underlying type.
Type aliases will generate `typedef` statements in the C++ code.

==== Syntax

`type` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>> = <<Type-Names,_type-name_>>

==== Semantics

The identifier is the name _N_ of the type.
The type name is the name _T_ of the underlying aliased type.
The definition associates the name _N_ with specified type _T'_.
The name _N_ can be used as a type elsewhere in the model.
There are no explicit values associated with _N_ in the model.

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
# Defines an alias to U32 called A
type A = U32
# Defines a struct type B whose member x has type A
struct B {
  x: A
  y: F32
} default { y = 1 }
