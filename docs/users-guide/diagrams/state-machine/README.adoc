== users-guide/diagrams/state-machine

This directory contains state machine diagrams for the FPP User's Guide.
To generate the diagrams, the command `puml` must be in your path,
and it must run Plant UML.
See https://plantuml.com.

There are two ways to generate PNG files:

. Run `puml [files]`.

. You can also run `redo` to generate EPS files.
You can then use a tool like `epspdf` to convert the EPS files
to PDF, and use a tool like Preview (on a Mac) to convert the
PDF files to PNG.

The first way is easier and it works in all cases, but it
generates bitmapped graphics, which don't look as nice as
vector graphics.
The second way requires more steps, and it doesn't work
in all cases, likely due to a bug in Plant UML.
However, it generates vector graphics.
